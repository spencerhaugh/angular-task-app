# Learning Angular

This is my first attempt at using Angular, and learning the basics of creating a CRUD app using the framework.  
This app was built following a tutorial by Brad Traversy.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
